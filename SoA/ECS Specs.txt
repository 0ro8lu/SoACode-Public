Usage:
 - Systems Are All Loaded Into Main Table
 - Systems Are Initialized In Three Passes
    * Calls init(i32 pass)
 - Systems Are Updated Every Frame
    * Calls update(i32 frame, const GameTime& time)
 - Systems May Be Ordered To Load/Save Internal State
    * Calls i32 getInternalStateSize(), save(ubyte* output), load(ubyte* data)

? Gravity ?
 - Requires "Physics" Component
 - Adds Gravitational Force To Acceleration
Physics
 - Requires "Position" Component
 - Applies Impulses To Positions
 - Simulates Positions As If They Were Point Bodies
